# Pomodoro Deluxe
## Opanuj JavaScript course project
The pomodoro technique is an effective time management method while learning to program. Wider
it was described by Marcin in a dedicated vlog (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz5AzAuBoac).


To use this method in an effective and pleasant way, it is worth using a dedicated tool,
combining the functions of a timer and a task management application.


This is a great opportunity to build something that will be useful in your daily life and will increase your effectiveness
